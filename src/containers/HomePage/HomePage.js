                    Hello, my name is Jose. I am a software developer who loves to share programming knowledge to those
                    around me. On this website you will find various guides and tutorials for common tasks that software
                    developers find themselves doing. These tasks will range from common git commands, installing and
                    setting up IDE's, setting up custom servers, some programming tricks, and so on! Feel free to look
                    around the site and find topics you find the most helpful!
